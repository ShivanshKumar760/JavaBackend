Encapsulation
Encapsulation means hiding internal details and providing controlled access to data.
Key Rules:

Make variables private
Provide public getter/setter methods
Add validation in setter methods

Why Encapsulation?

Security: Protect data from unauthorized access
Control: Validate data before storing
Flexibility: Change internal implementation without affecting other code
